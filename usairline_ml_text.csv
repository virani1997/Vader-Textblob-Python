positive,we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 's are not too big... Not too small!

negative,"at its worse. can not figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"
negative,passengers after a hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night hou airport. Wtf??!!

positive,"flight ua , gate b . And tell ray I somehow made it on to the flight out of IAH and did not have to wait for the one. :)"
negative,that is unfortunate. The was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
positive,But thanks for asking
negative,Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
negative,Yes. does not make that mistake any less absurd. does not change the fact that I am very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.

negative,why would they make me share a room?
negative,"tried calling too, but w/ min phn wait means we would miss options anyway"
negative,can you ask your guys with flight to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
negative,we are still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
negative,"for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
negative,"again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please."
negative,Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over hours at ... Going to miss my ride at help please!
negative,it is highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
negative,"well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
positive,man I can not wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you are a life sabe
negative,"Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing + hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like"

negative,agent helps the person in front of me. Finishes up with them and then walks away. The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
negative,Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
negative,Not encouraged that I will have my CPAP tonight.
negative,Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
neutral,an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
negative,Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this ker. ??
negative,"Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it is on time again with min to spare? do not say it is delayed unless you are sure!"
negative,"yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
neutral,where is my flight voucher?
negative,"Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let us not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
negative,has once again let me down. do not think I have ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
negative,yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
negative,UA ORD-LHR. bags are being loaded min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
negative,"Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives?"

negative,updated A aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I do not get it. How can I charge devices?
negative,was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
negative,"gate changes, two delays. Even the crew thinks the airline sucks"
negative,I am very frustrated and have wasted days now due to your equipment failures.
negative,computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. that is just ridiculous keep people updated!
negative,"Soooo, it is been days and you have offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
positive,Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.

positive,I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
negative,that is correctaI have spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. ( / )
negative,Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising passengers.
negative,what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA from Denver to Vegas?
negative,UA from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
negative,system failure again = bad trend. Software projects are like flying an airplane; there is no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
negative,lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.

negative,here is the ticket # please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee

neutral,", jon at thanks."
negative,when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.

negative,"of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
negative,I was not asking for a full refund but delaying me hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
negative,"flight was scheduled for : , it is : and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense"

positive,you are still the best
positive,"please give JetBlue all the permissions in the world! I am missing the oscars right now, and it is awful"

neutral,the man sitting next me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight.
negative,"sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated."
negative,This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there is a problem?
neutral,I have a disabled seat in row do I get to board earlier?
negative,"thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection."
negative,you are lucky we are still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
negative,so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
negative,"if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. do not quote terms and conditions."
negative,do you REALLY think it is okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure??
negative,"they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting."
neutral,flight JFK to TPA : am on Saturday! One way ticket!
negative,what is your excuse this time for delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
negative,"if you can not guarantee parents will sit with their children, do not sell tickets with that promise!"
negative,once you go blue you do not go back
negative,why are there so many delays to north east cities?
negative,kids fly. do not hire people who do not care about them. This guy.
negative,I should not be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my year old on a flight.
negative,"Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now."
negative,why would you hire a guy who does not care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable.
negative,"what is up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting."
positive,"For the record, that was less than a -minute turnaround time for the answer from the question. JetBlue rocks!"
negative,never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it.
negative,"from San Diego with a hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex JetBlue, even having over . travel miles, you are still nothing"
negative,it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so.
negative,Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
negative,"you have let me down. : delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really?"
negative,a year old can not sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick.

neutral,"Domestic. To be clear -- I do not have to sit in (your lovely) terminal, just need to be there hour prior to boarding? Thanks!"

negative,why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
negative,He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice.
positive,I appreciate your prompt response.
negative,nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably did not even pay for Choice
negative,well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
negative,I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
negative,does not seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that does not help
negative,this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
negative,we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.

positive,I am so going to miss US Airways. You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN.
negative,NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life.
negative,. I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at : pm.
negative,"+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for + years, but no more!"
negative,this response does not correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
negative,been at DCA at pm still here at am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
negative,"it was , almost hours Late Flight due to mechanical."
negative,"never flying again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service."
neutral,Mobile boarding pass email.

negative,I have been on three planes for flight and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE
negative,Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
negative,"Why were we loaded onto the plane ( hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for minutes"
negative,why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
negative,offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
positive,"a we are excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?a Spring Break !!!"
neutral,still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. what is up?
negative,that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading.

negative,"that is incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags."
positive,Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
neutral,and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking buttons.
negative,"the fact that you are making customers pay $ to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors"
negative,Iall do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
negative,your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide.
negative,worst experience ever with you guysasee my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.
negative,now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
negative,"please explain, I have plenty of time since I am STRANDED!!"
negative,"I doubt that, its : p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
negative,why does it cost $ to change a $ ticket when it only cost $ to purchase a new ticket?
negative,. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
negative,we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
negative,does not want me to get home
negative,"They do not stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?"
negative,"DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus plane for min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; announcement &gt; hour!"
negative,"- I bet you do not, but I am the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you."
negative,"I can not even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
negative,oh great after a hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving. Flight has been awful
negative,that is the st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
negative,never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
negative,"my buddies are currently delayed . hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation?"
negative,"Flights was the delay, Flight was my missed connectiona Help!"
negative,the flight that I did not connect to was .
negative,even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so will not be that difficult am sure
negative,yes .not sure how you guys do not know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
negative,"Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee $ I hope you all end up on unemployment."
negative,- BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
negative,sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane + minutes. The level of service I have come to expect.
negative,you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
negative,the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
negative,"st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched times. You call this customer service??"
negative,"due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
negative,"we can not afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can not afford to go home."
neutral,"but it is not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?"
negative,"ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded."
